# Requirements
## Introduction
- Number System Conversations - As we know Number Systems are the technique to represent numbers in computer architecture and Number System Conversion is the process by which we convert a number from one number system to another, there are four number systems - Binary, Octal, Decimal and Hexadecimal.
- In this project some operations of Binary system are implemented.
## Research

 ## Features and Benefits of project
 Number system conversions are one of the most fundamental concepts that computer scientists must learn. Itâ€™s an important step for anyone who wants to become a computer scientist or programmer..
 # Benefits
 - Numbersystems offer convenience.
 - Different numbersystems can be followedc in different cases 
 - Numbersystem conversions can minimize the memory usage.
 - Numbersystem conversions contribute Man-Machine communication.
 - 
## Defining Our System
### Architecture
-Binary nhumber system conversion is capable of performing following functions :- 
    - Converting a Binary number to Decimal number.
    - Converting a Binary number to Octal number.
    - Converting a Binary number to Hexadecimal number.
   
## SWOT ANALYSIS

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
- Students, Professionals and Developers who wants an utility for Binarynumber conversion.

## What:
- Many people still follows theoretical methods of conversion which sometimes become very diffficult and time consuming. If the amount of binary data to be converted is more then the theoretical process becomes very tedious. So, Binary conversion utility can come handy in such cases.
## When:
- Even in modren era of computer technology there is need for a tool in Man-Machine communication. We know that machines only understand binary language but a man might not and vice-versa.
- Better understanding of machines is possible only when we can understand the machine language. This Binary conversion tool has the scope in such cases.

## Where:
- This project is likely to emerge in educational and computer development sectors.

## How:
- Provided the binary data, this utility uses the simplified and theoretical methods of conversion which will contribute to the efiicient and faster conversions.
